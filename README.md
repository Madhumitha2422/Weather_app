# Weather App using Flask and OpenWeather API

This Weather App is a simple Flask-based web application that fetches current weather data using the OpenWeather API. Users can input a city name and receive real-time weather information.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask (`pip install Flask`)
- An API key from [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) (Create a free account to get an API key)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/weather-app.git
    cd weather-app
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set your OpenWeather API key:

    - Open `app.py` in a text editor.
    - Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY'` with your actual OpenWeather API key.

## Usage

1. Run the Flask app:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

3. Enter a city name in the input field and click the **Get Weather** button.

## Additional Notes

- This app retrieves weather data only for the current moment and for the specified city.
